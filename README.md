## Experimental / Extreme Challenges

_Maximalist set-pieces. Spectacle and scale are the point; practicality is not. Expect unwieldy builds, runaway volume, and theatrical excess._

| Blueprint                                                                                                                      | Description                                                                     | Achievability |

## Controlled Indulgence

_Discipline over desire. Pacing, sequencing, and rules turn comfort foods into structured trials._

### Notes

- **Achievability** is a practical gauge, not a dare.
- Keep `ReadMe.md` high-level; maintain exhaustive listings in `Index.md`.
- For large category growth, add sub-indexes within each `blueprints/<category>` folder.
