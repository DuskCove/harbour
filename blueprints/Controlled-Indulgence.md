# **Indulgence Blueprint: Structured Sessions**

A rotating set of six guided indulgence sessions.  
Rules are strict, food is simple, tone is firm.  
Once a session begins, nothing is wasted.

## **Session 4 – The Parade**

### **Narrative Prelude**

You enter the table like a parade ground. Each food item is a checkpoint, unavoidable, marked out before you. Your body knows the path, your mind anticipates the rules. There is no escape. This is a slow march of indulgence.

### **Preparation**

- 1 packet of mini sponge cakes (6 pack).
- 1 packet of custard slices (4 pack).
- 2 medium cream cakes, cut into quarters each.
- 6 jam sandwiches.
- Drink withheld until the parade is complete.

### **Rules**

- Every checkpoint (batch) must be finished once begun.
- Pauses are allowed only as described per batch.
- Mess is part of the ritual: smear, drip, and leave traces deliberately.

### **Structure**

- **Batch 1 – Sponge Checkpoint**: Eat 6 mini sponge cakes in order, one at a time. Pause 15 seconds between each to admire fullness and mess.
- **Batch 2 – Custard Bridge**: Custard slices eaten in sequence; each fully consumed before next. 30-second pause between slices, hands visible, aware of weight growing.
- **Batch 3 – Cream Crossing**: Two medium cream cakes, quartered; each quarter is a single obligation. Small sips allowed only after each cake is finished.
- **Batch 4 – Jam Terminus**: 6 jam sandwiches, eaten in two stacked slabs of three. Each slab must be finished before moving to the next.

### **Closing**

Remain seated for five minutes after the parade, observing the fullness and heaviness that marks completion. No cleaning, no drinks beyond what’s allowed. You are bound by the sequence.

## **Session 5 – The Gauntlet**

### **Narrative Prelude**

Chaos is framed. Foods appear in unpredictable order. Your will is tested. Every bite is a decision, but every decision is bound by the rules. You will be pushed, pulled, and tested for endurance. The Gauntlet does not forgive hesitation.

### **Preparation**

- 1 large trifle.
- 1 packet of cream rolls (6 pack).
- 1 small chocolate cake.
- 4 jam sandwiches.
- Drink withheld.

### **Rules**

- Each batch must be fully completed before moving to the next.
- Randomize order of sandwiches, buns, and slices; once drawn, the item must be eaten.
- Pauses are prescribed, not optional, to increase tension.
- Smearing, licking, and dripping are required for at least half of the batches.

### **Structure**

- **Batch 1 – Trifle Storm**: Divide trifle into four equal portions; eat sequentially. Observe and feel the weight growing.
- **Batch 2 – Cream Roll Run**: 6 rolls, shuffled. Eat each as it comes. Mess allowed.
- **Batch 3 – Chocolate Peak**: Single chocolate cake, quartered; each quarter must be completed in order.
- **Batch 4 – Jam Finale**: 4 jam sandwiches, stacked in two double slabs. Finish each slab entirely before the next.

### **Closing**

Two minutes of stillness after every batch, five minutes total at the end. Observe mess, fullness, and obedience. The Gauntlet is completed.

## **Session 6 – The Collapse**

### **Narrative Prelude**

This is the endgame. Volume, weight, and sweetness converge. Every bite is monumental. You cannot escape the inevitable fullness. The Collapse consumes you; surrender is total.

### **Preparation**

- 1 full family-sized cheesecake.
- 1 large trifle.
- 6 custard slices.
- 1 packet cream rolls (6 pack).
- 6 jam sandwiches pressed into slabs.
- Drink withheld until end.

### **Rules**

- Every batch must be completed in order once begun.
- Pause only when described per batch.
- Smear, drip, and savor the mess deliberately; it amplifies the ritual.
- Stop only if your body demands it—but the ritual continues in your mind until the end.

### **Structure**

- **Batch 1 – Cheesecake Obligation**: Cut into quarters, eat each fully. 1-minute pause between quarters.
- **Batch 2 – Trifle Obliteration**: Divide into four portions; consume sequentially with 1-minute pause between.
- **Batch 3 – Custard March**: 6 slices, eaten in order, with at least two messy bites per slice.
- **Batch 4 – Cream Roll Tower**: Eat the rolls stacked in pairs. Pause only between stacks.
- **Batch 5 – Jam Slab Finale**: 6 jam sandwiches pressed into double slabs; eat each slab entirely. Pause 2 minutes between slabs.

### **Closing**

Remain seated for at least ten minutes after completion, absorbing fullness, heaviness, and mess. Drink three sips only at the very end. Reflect on total surrender, the inevitable Collapse.
